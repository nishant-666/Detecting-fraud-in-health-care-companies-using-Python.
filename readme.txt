The main purpose of fraud is financial benefit. According to a recent survey, it is estimated that the number of false claims in the industry is approximately 15 per cent of total claims. A report suggests that the healthcare industry in India is losing approximately Rs 600-Rs 800 crores incurred on fraudulent claims annually. Frauds blows a hole in the insurance industry. Health insurance is a bleeding sector with very high claims ratio. So, to make health insurance industry free from fraud, it is necessary to focus on elimination or minimization of fake claims arriving through health insurance.

SVM(Support Vector Machine): SVM is a supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.


Linear Regression: Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.
